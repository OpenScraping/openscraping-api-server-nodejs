## OpenScraping API Server

The OpenScraping API server allows using the OpenScraping Node.js library to extract information from HTML pages using a JSON config file with xPath rules.

The server provides two features:
* A JSON HTTP API that allows sending in a JSON config and an HTML page and getting back the extracted data.
* An HTML and JavaScript test console that can be accessed from the browser and which allows testing JSON configs against HTML pages.
